Jan :tada:  â˜• (decaf)

Jack was here 2k19! Hello Jan, have a ðŸŒ³ for your allotment!
Jack came back: I know the previous pull was unacceptable, however, please accept an extra decaf coffee change instead. Or suggest an amend.

## GPG
Let's see if I can add GPG signing.

It worked after I changed my global email address (I think)
So now when commiting I'll add -S
```
$ git commit -S -am "message"
```

I am adding a new computer, with new ssh keys and copied gpg, see if it works


Hello guys! :) - Francesca
