So I don't waste time and pollute history on other projects

## GPG
Let's see if I can add GPG signing.

It worked after I changed my global email address (I think)
So now when commiting I'll add -S
```
$ git commit -S -am "message"
```

I am adding a new computer, with new ssh keys and copied gpg, see if it works
